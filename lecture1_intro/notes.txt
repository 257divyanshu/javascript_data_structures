📍 why learn data structures
- using correct data structure is necessary for building an efficient software program
- it improves logic building
- it's asked in coding interviews
- they provide better understanding of algorithms

📍 friends on facebook example
- we don't have any hierarchy here
- we have people here, who have relationships (friend) with other people
- so, we will use graph data structure

📍 family members and relationship example
- here we have hierarchy, we will maintain that
- here we have relationships, we will maintain that
- we will use tree data structure to store such data
- because, in a tree data structure, we have hierarchy, we have relationships

📍 selling tickets online example
- we have limited tickets
- 1000s of people want to buy that ticket
- we will sell tickets on first come first served basis
- so we will keep users in a queue data structure

📍 to do list example
- all items have equal importance
- any item can be taked and done first
- so we will keep todo items in an array

📍 what is data structure?
- information technology is all about data
- we store data
- we perform operations on data
- we transfer data
- e.g. ordering a phone
- data should be stored in a way so that it is easier to manage and use
